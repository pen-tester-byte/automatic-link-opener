# automatic-link-opener

This is an automatic link opener which can do two functions:-
1. Open a link
2. Crash the computer

This will crash the computer if there's no time delay.

Three python modules are required to make it fully functional:-
1. Webbrowser (to open a link)
2. Time (to add time delays)
3. Pyttsx3 (to let the user know what's happening if he/she is doing another work)
